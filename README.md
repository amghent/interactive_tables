# interactive_tables: iTables Configuration

iTables is an implementation of the javascript module found on datatables.net.  This fantastic module is wrapped by iTables to function in a Jupyter notebook.  This work is done by Marc Wouts and can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/mwouts/itables

The only remark I can give on this tremendous work, is that the configuration of the module is too complicated for a data scientist.  This module is exactly that: a wrapper around iTables for easier configuration, accessible to a data scientist.


## How to use

At this moment, there is no package available for this module, but it will be created in a later stage.  For now, you must simply put the source files somewhere on your PYTHONPATH and import the module.

*As this is developed by Arcelor Mittal in Ghent (BE), there's no need for the moment to make this a package, as we distribute this in another way along other modules.*
